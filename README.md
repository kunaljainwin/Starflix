## User manual
The Starflix landing page resembles most other entertainment streaming apps so there should be some familiarity for the user.

There is a featured show/movie at the top of the page, and each row after that consists of a series of shows/movies belonging to specific categories denoted by the title above each row.
Each show/movie poster shows the cover art for that title and IMDB rating in the top right-hand corner.

Clicking on one of the title posters opens a player below where the trailer for that title plays. Clicking on a title while the trailer is playing will close the currently playing trailer and the landing page will go back to its original state.

These categories can be browsed by the user as they are shown; however, the user may also search for specific titles.

# Contribution guidelines
 We kept those same rules in 2021 and will be doing the same this year, continually refining them based on feedback from the community to ensure Hacktoberfest is a positive experience.

As part of our continued dedication to providing a high-quality, helpful experience that brings the open source community together, we have the following rules for this year:

Maintainers must opt-in to Hacktoberfest by adding the 'hacktoberfest' topic to their participating repository/project in GitHub or GitLab or by applying the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label to individual PR/MRs.
Spammy PR/MRs will be labeled. If the PR/MR has any label that contains the word 'spam', then it will be treated as spam and will not be counted for Hacktoberfest. Users that have two or more spam PR/MRs will be permanently disqualified.
PR/MRs only count once accepted by a maintainer. Maintainers of opted-in projects can accept PR/MRs from contributors by merging them, giving them an overall approving review, or labeling them as â€˜hacktoberfest-acceptedâ€™.
Weâ€™ve instituted a reporting system for bad repositories. The Hacktoberfest community can let us know about repositories designed to cheat Hacktoberfest. 
Weâ€™ve reduced the emphasis on the t-shirt and winning a prize. Instead, weâ€™re focused on how to bring communities together to improve open source for all in a positive way.


# Getting started

To complete Hacktoberfest, you must contribute four accepted pull requests or merge requests to opted-in repos on GitHub or GitLab, but we encourage participation of all levelsâ€“you can also participate by completing a single PR/MR, making a donation to your favorite open-source project, or organizing or attending a virtual event. Participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can choose one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt, while supplies last.
